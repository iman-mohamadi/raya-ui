- **Accessible:** Built on top of `reka-ui` (formerly radix-vue) for full accessibility.
- **Themable:** Designed to work seamlessly with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn's design tokens.
- **Vue 3 & Nuxt Ready:** Optimized for the modern Vue ecosystem.

## 📦 Installation

You can add components to your project using the `shadcn-vue` CLI or by manually copying the code.

### CLI (Recommended)

Use the CLI to automatically install a component and its dependencies.
